        Moreover, the earth is considered the only planet in the universe that supports life. The environment can be
        understood as a blanket that keeps life on the planet sage and sound.

        Life of humans, animals and birds is with this environment. We are carelessly replacing natural environment into
        artificial one.



        Instead of greenery, Plantation and natural objects now there exists artificial things like buildings,
        complexes, streets and vehicles. They emit dangerous gases that pollute our environment.

        As it is known that continuity of life on this planet earth is possible with healthy environment. The selfish
        activities of humans are the biggest threat to our natural healthy environment.

        The mankind has been degrading the natural components of environment. He has been misusing the environment to
        attain success and prosperity

        Our life is interconnected with every component present in our surroundings. The air that we continuously
        breathe to live, the water which we frequent drink, are the parts of our environment.

        Specially man made technological advancement is spoiling our surroundings excessively. It ultimately destroys
        the balance and equilibrium of nature which is fatal to all living forms on the earth.

        All parts of our environment including hydrosphere and lithosphere have been destroyed due to man made
        environment.



        It means that the man made technological activities are the sole cause of destruction of our environment.

        Environmental degradation is a global issue. It is adversely affecting physical and mental health of humans. It
        has negatively affected our daily lives.

        We are suffering socially, economically, emotionally and intellectually. Environmental contaminants have spread
        deadly diseases. The whole world is facing the issues caused by the loss of natural environment.

        Our environment is being polluted due to industrial waste. The Agricultural waste, increasing population, smoke
        of vehicles, use of plastic, fossil fuel combustion.

        Environmental degradation is the issue of the whole world. If this problem is not addressed properly it will
        cause loss of life.

        The excessive use of fuels to meet our needs is killing our environment and its components like air and water.

    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
        Cause of Environmental Degradation:
        Human activities are the major cause of environmental degradation because most of the activities humans do harm
        the environment in some way. The activities of humans that causes environmental degradation is pollution,
        defective environmental policies, chemicals, greenhouse gases, global warming, ozone depletion, etc.

        All these affect the environment badly. Besides, these the overuse of natural resources will create a situation
        in the future there will be no resources for consumption. And the most basic necessity of living air will get so
        polluted that humans have to use bottled oxygen for breathing.
